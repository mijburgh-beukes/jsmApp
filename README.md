# jsmApp

As newly minted full stack software developers, [Jordan Tuinman](https://github.com/jordan-tuinman) and [myself](https://github.com/mijburgh-beukes) are looking for jobs, so we thought, why not build an app to help with the process!

Job Search Management App can do with a better name, but that wasn't the point of the exercise. The first goal of this project is to learn use React-Native to build apps.
This will be our first foray into Native-land. We welcome you to check in on this project from time to time.
